# Core-Collection-Genomics-Toolkit
A list of tools and pipelines useful for analyzing the genome of 100 accession in the core collections (e.g. vegetable crops).


-Visualization tools for displaying outputs from [SyRI][SyRI].

[corrPNG][corrPNG]  -Software for performing GWAS using gene copy-number variations, based on outputs from [pangene][pangene].


[CUSCO][CUSCO]  -Pipeline for rapidly extracting single-copy orthologs from genome FASTA files and constructing phylogenetic trees.


-Visualization tools for three types of GWAS outputs.
